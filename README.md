# Skeleton animation with Python

Skeleton animation with `MatplotLib` using Motion Capture (MoCap) data. Kinematics are performed using quaternion parameterization.

Data: Human 3.6M dataset. Downloaded from the work of [Mart√≠nez and Romero](https://github.com/una-dinosauria/human-motion-prediction) (Exponential map / Axis-angle parameterization).
